#SuperJS Validate.

> **Disclaimer:** SuperJS is under heavy development at the moment, and breaking changes are likely. The intent is
to publish a stable release during the first quarter of 2015.

Validations return true or false depending on whether they pass or fail. In addition to 
the validations, the library provides a mechanism to setup and process a group of validations
using the bluebird Promise Library.
